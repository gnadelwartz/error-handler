Hi Kay,

Just wanted to say thankyou for your post about slow loading of dashboard on Webmin. It made me think a bit more about my own systems.

I had a bit more of a poke at mine after it got slow again, and I might have fixed it. 

I'm not going to reply to the main thread yet, as it may break again :-/

The option I've disabled is the "Reverse-resolve connected IP address" in the "Ports and Addresses" page.

It seems that it struggles. I think it's because my main workstation is on DHCP, and therefore doesn't have an entry in 
my local network DNS server (I don't have DHCP linked into DNS), so Webmin might be sitting spinning in a loop unneccessarily, 
trying to reverse-resolve, eventually giving up.

Matt
